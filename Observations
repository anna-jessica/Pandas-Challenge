observable trends:
1) Schools that had the lowest budget per student(the 2 lowest budget bins) had the highest reading scores, math scores and
the highest overall passing rate.
2)Large schools (2000-5000 students) had the lowest  scores for overall passing rate, reading and math. This could mean that larger schools
have larger classrooms(more students per class) so maybe the students aren't getting enough support/time from the teacher.
